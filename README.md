## Conventions:
Modules:
Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

Classes:
Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

Functions & Local Variables:
lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability
